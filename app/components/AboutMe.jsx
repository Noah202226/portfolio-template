          I'm Lira Ann Mendoza, adaptable professional with a diverse background
          spanning banking and finance, customer service, and freelance work. My
          journey began with a degree in Banking and Finance, laying a solid
          foundation for my career. This foundation led me to roles such as
          administrative staff at the POEA airport, where I honed my
          organizational and interpersonal skills, followed by five years as a
          casino dealer, further developing my ability to manage pressure and
          interact with diverse clientele.

          The arrival of my eldest child during the pandemic marked a
          significant turning point. The experience highlighted the importance
          of work-life balance, leading me to embrace the flexibility of
          freelance work in 2021. This transition has been incredibly rewarding.
          In the past few years, I've successfully completed over five diverse
          freelance projects, demonstrating my versatility and commitment to
          delivering high-quality results. I thrive in collaborative
          environments and find immense satisfaction in partnering with clients
          to achieve their goals, providing support and exceeding their
          expectations. The flexibility of freelance work allows me to
          effectively manage my time, dedicating ample quality time to my
          children while maintaining a successful professional life. I'm
          passionate about my work and committed to building long-lasting
          relationships with clients, offering reliable and efficient service.
          I'm confident that my unique blend of experience and dedication makes
          me a valuable asset to any team. I am excited to continue growing my
          skills and contributing to innovative projects.
